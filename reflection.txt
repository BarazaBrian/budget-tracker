REFLECTION - Budget Tracker Project
-----------------------------------

What I Learned
--------------
This project helped me understand Object-Oriented Programming concepts in a practical way. 
I learned how to implement inheritance by creating Income and Expense as subclasses of 
Transaction, and how to use the super() constructor to initialize inherited attributes. 
I also gained experience with input validation and error handling, ensuring the program 
doesn't crash when users enter invalid data. Working with collections (lists) to store 
and filter transactions improved my understanding of data structures.


Challenges I Faced
------------------
The main challenge was implementing the filtering system with multiple options. I had to 
ensure that the filter logic correctly handled different search criteria (type, category, 
and month). Another challenge was validating user input for amounts - I needed to handle 
both non-numeric inputs and negative numbers. Initially, I struggled with organizing the 
code into logical functions, but breaking down the program into smaller methods made it 
more manageable.


How I Intend to Improve It
---------------------------
Given more time, I would add:
1. Date validation to ensure proper format (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. An "undo last transaction" feature to remove mistakes
3. Budget threshold warnings when expenses exceed a certain limit
4. Export summary to a text file for record-keeping
5. More detailed error messages to guide users
6. Unit tests to verify that calculations are correct

I would also improve the user interface with better formatting and color-coded output 
to distinguish between income and expenses more clearly.
